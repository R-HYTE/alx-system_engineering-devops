# Incident Postmortem Guidelines

## Overview

A well-constructed incident postmortem is crucial for learning from system failures, improving processes, and enhancing overall system reliability. This document outlines the essential components that should be included in a comprehensive postmortem report.

## Must-Haves for a Great Postmortem

1. **Issue Summary:**
   - Clearly state the duration of the outage, including start and end times with the timezone.
   - Define the impact on users and services affected.

2. **Timeline:**
   - Provide a detailed chronological timeline of events, from the detection of the issue to its resolution.
   - Include key actions taken, escalations, and any misleading paths that were explored during the investigation.

3. **Root Cause and Resolution:**
   - Clearly identify and explain the root cause of the incident.
   - Describe in detail how the issue was resolved, ensuring a return to normal operations.

4. **Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
   - Highlight improvements and fixes that can be made to prevent similar incidents.
   - Specify tasks and actionable items to address the root cause and enhance system reliability.

5. **Communication Details:**
   - Document how the incident was communicated to relevant stakeholders, both internally and externally.
   - Include any customer-facing communications or updates.

6. **Lessons Learned:**
   - Summarize the key lessons learned from the incident.
   - Discuss what worked well and what could be improved in the incident response process.

7. **Team Contributions:**
   - Acknowledge the efforts of the team members involved in resolving the incident.
   - Highlight successful collaboration and problem-solving.

8. **Graphs, Charts, or Diagrams:**
   - Use visuals to enhance understanding, such as timelines, system architecture diagrams, or graphs depicting key metrics during the incident.

9. **Humor or Anecdotes (Optional):**
   - While not essential, injecting a bit of humor or storytelling can make the postmortem more engaging and memorable.

10. **References and Documentation:**
    - Provide links to relevant documentation, monitoring tools, or other resources used during the incident.

11. **Post-Incident Review Meeting Schedule:**
    - Include plans for a post-incident review meeting to discuss findings, share insights, and update incident response procedures.

12. **Continuous Improvement Plan:**
    - Outline long-term strategies for continuous improvement in system reliability, monitoring, and incident response.

13. **Cross-Functional Collaboration:**
    - Encourage collaboration across teams and departments to foster a culture of shared responsibility for system reliability.

Remember that the primary goal of a postmortem is to learn from incidents and prevent their recurrence. A well-structured postmortem not only serves as documentation but also as a valuable resource for ongoing improvement in system resilience and operational efficiency.
