## Enhanced Infrastructure Design:

### Servers:

1. **User Accessing Website:**
   - A user wants to access the website www.foobar.com.

2. **Domain Name (foobar.com):**
   - The domain name (foobar.com) is registered and configured with a www record pointing to the load balancer's IP address.

### Load-Balancer (HAproxy):

- **Why it's added:**
  - Load balancer is crucial for distributing traffic across multiple servers, enhancing performance, scalability, and redundancy.

- **Distribution Algorithm:**
  - Round-robin distribution algorithm for even load distribution.

### Web Server (Nginx):

- **Why it's added:**
  - Nginx acts as the web server, managing static content and serving as a reverse proxy. It contributes to performance and SSL termination.

### Application Server:

- **Why it's added:**
  - The application server executes dynamic code, handling requests generated by users and interacting with the database.

### Application Files (Code Base):

- **Why it's added:**
  - The application codebase contains the logic and functionality of the website. Executed by the application server.

### Database (MySQL - Primary-Replica Cluster):

- **Why it's added:**
  - Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster for data redundancy, high availability, and fault tolerance.

### Firewalls:

- **Why they're added:**
  - Firewalls are added to control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic, enhancing the overall security of the infrastructure.

### SSL Certificate:

- **Why it's added:**
  - SSL certificate is added to enable HTTPS, securing data transmission between the server and users, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.

### Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors):

- **Why they're added:**
  - Monitoring clients (data collectors) are integrated with services like Sumo Logic to collect and analyze real-time data, aiding in proactive issue detection and resolution.

### Issues with the Infrastructure:

1. **Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level:**
   - Terminating SSL at the load balancer may expose unencrypted data between the load balancer and the internal servers, posing a security risk. End-to-end encryption is recommended.

2. **Single MySQL Server Capable of Accepting Writes:**
   - Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a single point of failure for write operations. Implementing a Primary-Replica setup with multiple write-capable nodes would enhance fault tolerance.

3. **Identical Servers with All Components:**
   - Having identical servers with the same components might lead to uniform vulnerabilities. Diversifying server configurations can provide resilience against specific software or hardware failures. Additionally, a variety of server types can optimize performance for different workloads.
  
4. **QPS Monitoring for Web Server:**
   - To monitor web server QPS (Queries Per Second), you can utilize monitoring tools to track the incoming requests and analyze their rate. For Nginx, you can enable and analyze the access logs or use specific monitoring plugins/tools tailored for Nginx.

Remember, these recommendations and issues are contingent on the specific needs and goals of your infrastructure. Adjustments may be required based on the scale, purpose, and security considerations of your application.
